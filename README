sample config.yml in plugins/Splash/config.yml:

--
PLAYER_JOIN: http://localhost/api/player/join
PLAYER_QUIT: http://localhost/api/player/quit
PLAYER_DEATH: http://localhost/api/player/death
--

That's it! Just set up a webapp to handle those requests and you're good. If you're Splashing, maybe you could get soaked?

TODO:
 * some sort of token-based auth
 * more server events
 * more information sent in the HTTP request
 * retry on non-200-level response status codes
 * periodically sending a player list so soaked can verify its own internal state of who's currently online
