sample config.yml in plugins/Splash/config.yml:

--
PLAYER_JOIN: http://localhost/api/player/join
PLAYER_QUIT: http://localhost/api/player/quit
PLAYER_DEATH: http://localhost/api/player/death
--

That's it! Just set up a webapp to handle those requests and you're good.

Possible enhancements: some sort of token-based auth, more mappable server events, more information sent in the HTTP request
